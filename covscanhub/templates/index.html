<p>
Covscan is a tool that allows Red Hat users to run Coverity Scan on their packages<br />
without logging on the Coverity server or installing their own Coverity server.<br />
Users only need to download and install the covscan client and its requirements,<br />
configure the client and acquire a valid Kerberos ticket (if not acquired already).<br />
The usage of the covscan client is similar to brew/koji.<br />
The client provides an easy to use command line interface.
</p>

<p>
Another benefit for covscan users in already included workarounds for Coverity bugs;<br />
especially C++ packages are hard to scan with the default Coverity setup.
</p>

<p>
Please remember that we have only one shared Coverity license<br />
and that's why only one package can be analyzed at a time in the whole Red Hat.<br />
Please don't abuse this tool with multiple scans of scan expensive packages.<br />
If we experience overload of this kind, we will blacklist the individuals.
</p>
